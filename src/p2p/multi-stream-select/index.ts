 *
 * multistream-select is protocol multiplexing per connection/stream.
 * Full spec: https://github.com/multiformats/multistream-select
 *
 * ## Select a protocol flow
 *
 * The caller will send "interactive" messages, expecting for some acknowledgement
 * from the callee, which will "select" the handler for the desired and supported protocol:
 *
 * ```
 * < /multistream-select/0.3.0  # i speak multistream-select/0.3.0
 * > /multistream-select/0.3.0  # ok, let's speak multistream-select/0.3.0
 * > /ipfs-dht/0.2.3            # i want to speak ipfs-dht/0.2.3
 * < na                         # ipfs-dht/0.2.3 is not available
 * > /ipfs-dht/0.1.9            # What about ipfs-dht/0.1.9 ?
 * < /ipfs-dht/0.1.9            # ok let's speak ipfs-dht/0.1.9 -- in a sense acts as an ACK
 * > <dht-message>
 * > <dht-message>
 * > <dht-message>
 * ```
